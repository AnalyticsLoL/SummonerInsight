# SummonerInsight
Website showing users and champion data of League of Legends

## Redux

Define global flags in Context.js and import them in other components (not constant functions).

## Ideas for next stuff
- [ ] Filter matchhistory by queuetype and gamemode
- [ ] Make dark mode and day mode pages using css var
- [ ] Add a open/close menu to show more elements of games (check op.gg for ref)
- [ ] Add tags with First Blood, First Tower etc...

## Feedbacks
- Team Summoner names two columns take too much space
- Add skins in game
- Add a more general season/split statistique section with draft/aram...
- Add live games options
- Use i18next for multiple languages support
- Win prediction
- Mobile app
- match blocks take too much space, should be smaller and ouvrable to allow users to see more than 3 games at once
- teams player names too big, and too much spacing
- champion icon too big
- Add icons from the game for hp, gold, ap, ad, etc...
- Add cookies (detect region of the user)
