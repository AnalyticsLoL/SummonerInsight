# SummonerInsight
Website showing users and champion data of League of Legends

## Redux

Define global flags in Context.js and import them in other components (not constant functions).

## Ideas for next stuff

- [ ] Make dark mode and day mode pages using css var
- [ ] Clickable links for players in matches
- [ ] Add a open/close menu to show more elements of games (check op.gg for ref)
- [ ] Give more match infos on the same view, feeling like infos is to concised right now, (Maybe show less infos for matches when match menu closed)
- [ ] Make hover over items show a tiny text description of it
