## Data
The championFull.json contains a lot of data on each champions like infos for each spell's levels, as well as descriptions and is specific to patch 10.10.3224670 from May 2020. 
However, it seems to not contain very champion, like Samira key 360 which came after. In this case I downloaded the champion.json path 14.21.1 from the riot api docs.
